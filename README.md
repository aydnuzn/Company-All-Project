Company All Project aims to provide services to top-level companies. This project was designed using the Spring-Boot framework, following the MVC design pattern. RESTful is used as the service. RESTful API service is provided through Swagger. MySql was used as the database during the design phase. JPA, one of the ORM tools, was used to manage the database. While developing the interface, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, Bootstrap5 and JavaScript were used. In the back-end part, Java, JavaScript languages are used. JQuery is used on the JavaScript side.
